        <h1>7 LAYER DIP</h1>

            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p> My mom's 7-layer dip is a big hit at all small gatherings! Refried beans are layered with guacamole, 
                taco-seasoned sour cream, veggies, and cheese; it's perfect for dipping tortilla chips. 
            </p>
            <p> The dip traditionally takes less time to disappear into bellies than it does to prepare.</p>
