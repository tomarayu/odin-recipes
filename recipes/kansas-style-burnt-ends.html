            <h4> Steps </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Season beef with dry rub, and double wrap in foil.
                    Place on a sheet pan or in a baking dish, seam side up, and roast in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours. </li>
                <li>Let rest for 1 hour. Unwrap and transfer to a cutting board. Reserve all juices. Cut into 1-inch cubes and transfer to a mixing bowl.
                    Add cooking juices, more dry rub if desired, and bbq sauce. Mix well, wrap, and refrigerate overnight.  </li>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Transfer beef into a shallow baking dish and brush generously with bbq sauce. </li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven until meat starts to char around the edges, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and brush again with bbq sauce.
                <li>Roast until the "burnt ends" are as tender as you want, about 1 1/2 hours more </li>
                <li>Transfer the "burnt ends" onto the rolls, and finish with cheese whiz, onions, peppers, and green onions. </li>
